          <p>
            I graduated from Boise State University in May of 2018. I held two
            positions in Boise before moving to San Diego where I became an
            Account Coordinator for a company called
            <a href="https://www.slidegenius.com/">SlideGenius</a>. COVID-19
            caused the company to do a round of layoffs which I was a part of
            unfortunately. After much time and thought, I have decided to change
            career paths and become a Software Developer which is why I enrolled
            in CodeWorks Boise for their Immersive Full Stack 12 week program.
            Upon receiving my certificate, I will be on the hunt for a position
            as a Software Developer.
